# Welcome to a place where Coffee & Code people can collaborate.

This repo is used to learn about git, github, and collaborate on
solutions to whatever kind of problems we tackle at Coffee & Code or
other meetups.

# Some solution to exercises from Free Code Camp

These files are designed to be developed and run on your local machine.  While the FreeCodeCamp provides a web app that lets you work on solutions to their problems, doing it this way provides more experience doing things the way a real developer might.  That means using command line tools, git, test driven development, etc.

## Setup for Mac OS

_instructions are purposely vague.  Part of the fun is figuring out how to make this stuff run._

- Install node.
```
$ brew install node
```

- Install some npm modules:
```
$ npm install -g mocha
$ npm install -g expect.js
```

- Run it!
```
$ mocha pairwise_test.js
```

- Do a happy dance once it works

- Reach on #freecodecamp if its not working.

- Do more exercises in this style, add your solutions to this folder.
